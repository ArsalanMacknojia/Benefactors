# Benefactors
The recent pandemic has altered the way of life for a lot of people across the globe. Some communities have been impacted so severely that basic necessities like delivery of food and medicines to quarantined neighbourhoods has become a formidable challenge. To mitigate the situation, we envisioned a platform to bring people together while practicing social distancing. Benefactors allows people in need to connect with volunteers to tackle essential services and errands efficiently and at no cost. Expected services include, delivery, shopping, medical supplies, and others.
